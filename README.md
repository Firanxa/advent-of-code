# Advent of Code

Maybe the real search for Santa are the elf friends we make along the way.
Cheers to AoC 2024 being the first year I don't get filtered (hopefully).

_Christmas update_: Sadly, I was filtered once again.
I didn't make it to Christmas, but I got further, learned more, and had more fun than I did last year, which was my first AoC.
I lost steam only once I got sick around Day 15, and the holiday rush naturally took up my free time after that.
Still, I'm happy with what I was able to do, and I'll be happy to come back to finish this soon.
