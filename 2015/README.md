# AoC 2015: Let It Snow

These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2015.
I'm starting from the very beginning and going forward until I get all 500 stars.
(My first "live" AoC was 2023&ndash;I love it and am sorry I missed out on so much over the years!)

In 2015, some days didn't supply a whole test input to check against.
In those cases, I just picked some or all the examples in the problem description to provide some simple code validation.
